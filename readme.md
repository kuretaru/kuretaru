# Hello, Universe! üëã

I'm known as @Klaterrr, Kuretaru, Shanaecl, Ivan, or Johan ‚Äì pick your favorite! I'm an explorer of the digital realm, with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## Areas of Fascination and Focus üß†

My primary interests lie in the profound depths of **Neural Networks**, particularly the fundamental questions that often get overlooked. I'm not just about building models; I'm about understanding the *why* behind the *how*. Lately, I've become particularly captivated by:

*   **The Elusive Nature of Qualia:** I'm deeply intrigued by the complex questions surrounding subjective experience and consciousness in artificial systems. It's not enough to make them *work*; I want to explore *what it feels like* (or if it even feels like anything!)

## Collaboration Goals ü§ù

I'm actively seeking collaborations on projects that involve:

*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Systems:** Pushing the limits of natural and expressive voice synthesis.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Delving into the nuances of language, aiming for true understanding, not just pattern matching.
*   **Vision-and-Language Processing (VPT) Systems:** Bridging the gap between sight and language for more comprehensive AI interactions.

I'm keen to work with fellow researchers and developers who are not afraid to tackle challenging, thought-provoking problems. Let's not just make things *smarter*, let's make them *more meaningful*.
